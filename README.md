# PostOpPainGuard™

### Predicting and Optimizing Post-Operative Analgesia in Rabbits Using Synthetic Data and AI

---

# Phase 1 — Project Setup

## Step 1: Project Overview & Rationale

### 1. Research Problem

1. **Concept:** Develop **PostOpGuard**, a predictive framework to identify **rabbits at risk of requiring additional analgesics post-surgery** across multiple surgical procedures.
2. **Objective:** Compute an **AnalgesiaNeedScore (0–100)** to guide **timely clinical intervention within 24 hours post-operatively**.
3. **Scope:** Uses only **demographic, surgical, anesthetic, and pre-operative clinical features**, without video or invasive telemetry.
4. **Ethical Compliance:** Fully aligned with **AAALAC, IACUC, and the 3Rs principles**, emphasizing **refinement, non-invasive monitoring, and actionable welfare outcomes**.


### 2. Context & Background

Recent deep learning approaches using video achieved approximately 87% accuracy for rabbit post-operative pain ([Feighelstein et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41774-2)).
However, such methods require high-quality imaging and complex setups that limit scalability and interpretability.

**PostOpGuard Advantages:**

* Utilizes structured clinical and surgical features for **interpretable, scalable predictions**
* Supports multiple surgery types and is adaptable to other lab species (rats, mice, zebrafish)

**Synthetic Data Simulation:**

* Generated due to the absence of publicly available post-operative rabbit datasets
* Simulates a **complete laboratory environment** of 5,000 rabbits, 5 surgery types, and 10 veterinarians (VetID)
* Introduces **inter-observer variability, missing data, and rare high-pain events**
* Maintains **plausible physiological and procedural distributions**
* Ensures **reproducibility** with fixed random seeds and controlled noise
* Enables **robust model training, validation, and reproducibility** while minimizing live-animal use


### 3. Importance of Multi-Surgery Modeling

Pain perception and analgesic needs differ across procedures. Including multiple surgery types (Ovariohysterectomy, Castration, BoneDefect, Catheterization, OcularImplant) enhances:

* **Model generalization**
* **Per-procedure validation**
* **Capture of inter-procedure variability**


### 4. Ethical & Regulatory Considerations

* All datasets are **compliant with animal welfare and research standards**
* **IACUC Alignment:** Predictions support, not replace, professional veterinary judgment
* **3Rs Compliance:**

  * **Reduction:** Minimizes exploratory animal use
  * **Refinement:** Improves prediction accuracy and analgesic planning
  * **Replacement:** Utilizes synthetic data to minimize live-animal use
* Outputs are **auditable**, including key feature contributions and decision factors


### 5. Species Context & Adaptability

* **Species-Adaptable Framework:** Readily transferable to rats, mice, or zebrafish with minimal adjustments
* **Why Rabbits:**

  * Common model in ocular, orthopedic, and pharmacological research
  * Established pain metrics (grimace scales, behavioral scoring)
  * Moderate body size allows precise dosing and procedural consistency
  * Captures a full pain spectrum from minor to major procedures

**Key Takeaway:**
Rabbits offer a **scientifically and ethically sound model** for developing interpretable, high-fidelity AI tools in laboratory pain prediction. Synthetic simulation allows robust validation while upholding ethical obligations.

# Phase 3 — Feature Preparation

## Step 1: Derived Features

### Objectives

* Generate **biologically meaningful features** for post-operative analgesia prediction.
* Include **interaction terms** to strengthen signal and reduce underfitting.


### Derived Features (Refined for Realism)

1. **`DurationPerKg`** = DurationMin / WeightKg
   Normalizes surgery duration by rabbit size — a strong predictor of post-operative pain.

2. **`AnalgesicScore`** = log-transformed and standardized `IntraOpAnalgesicMgPerKg`
   Captures diminishing analgesic effects and ensures numerical stability.

3. **`PreOpRiskScore`** = weighted combination of `PreOpGrimace` + `PreOpBiomarker`
   Models baseline pain risk prior to surgery.

4. **`SurgeryComplexity`** = Minor vs. Major
   *(Ovariohysterectomy, BoneDefect, OcularImplant = Major)*
   Major surgeries are biologically expected to induce greater pain.

5. **`VetBiasFlag`** = normalized residual `PreOpGrimace` per `ObserverID` (clipped -2 to 2)
   Adjusts for inter-observer variability in pain scoring.

6. **Interaction Features:**

   * `DurationPerKg × PreOpGrimace` → duration and pre-op grimace synergy
   * `PreOpRiskScore × SurgeryComplexity` → baseline risk vs. procedure type
   * `DurationPerKg × AnalgesicScore` → analgesic dosing vs. surgical intensity
   * `LocalBlock × PreOpGrimace` → local anesthetic effect relative to baseline pain


### Veterinary Rationale

* Weight-adjusted duration standardizes pain stimulus across rabbits.
* Pre-operative grimace and biomarkers act as early pain risk indicators.
* Observer bias correction accounts for inter-rater variability.
* Interaction terms capture realistic biological relationships.

---

### Machine Learning Rationale

* Hand-crafted features help capture nonlinear biological effects.
* Interaction terms reduce underfitting and enhance predictive realism.
* Normalization supports numerical stability in gradient-based and tree-based models.

* Ensures balanced representation of pain categories (Low, Medium, High).
* Preserves biological variability without over-stratifying rare cases.
* Maintains realistic pain distributions across surgical procedures.


### Machine Learning Rationale

* Reduces class imbalance bias.
* Improves generalization across pain levels.

* Avoid excluding features tied to genuine physiological processes.
* Support transparent scientific validation and translation.


### Machine Learning Rationale

* Prevent unstable coefficients in linear and ordinal models.
* Remove redundant variables while preserving biological signal.
* Enhance interpretability and generalizability for regulatory applications.
* Retain interaction terms to represent complex physiological dynamics.

> **Key Principle:**
> Balance **biological interpretability** with **statistical discipline** — remove only what is redundant, never what is meaningful.

---

## Phase 3 — Step 4: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Management

### Objectives

1. Remove only **highly redundant** features (correlation > 0.95).
2. Use **tree-based feature importance** to exclude features contributing <1%.
3. Retain all **biologically meaningful** and **interaction-rich** variables.
4. Apply **Lasso regularization** when handling large biomarker sets (>10 variables).


### Veterinary Rationale

* Preserve clinically interpretable and pain-relevant predictors.
* Maintain interaction terms crucial for rare or high-pain conditions.
* Retain biological variability essential for realistic predictions.


### Machine Learning Rationale

* Limit overfitting through minimal, principled pruning.
* Maintain high signal-to-noise ratio for model strength.
* Apply regularization for large feature spaces to ensure robustness.
* Preserve transparency for explainability and compliance.

> **Key Principle:**
> **Prune with precision.** Remove only redundancy—preserve every feature that adds biological or predictive value.

# Phase 4 — Modeling Framework

## Step 1: Baseline Analgesia Indicator (Rule-Based)

### Objectives

1. Create a **simple, interpretable rule-based baseline analgesia score**.
2. Capture **strong biological signals** before machine learning (ML) modeling.
3. Incorporate multiple factors: `Duration`, `LocalBlock`, `PreOpGrimace`, `PreOpBiomarker`, and `Weight`.
4. Add **biological noise (±3–7)** to mimic natural variability.


### Example Rules

* **BoneDefect:** `DurationMin > 60` and `LocalBlock == 0` → High pain; further increased by `PreOpGrimace` and `PreOpBiomarker`.
* **Ovariohysterectomy:** `DurationMin > 45` and `PreOpGrimace > 3` → Medium–High pain.
* **Castration / Catheter:** Minor surgeries → Low pain unless duration or grimace elevated.
* **OcularImplant:** Medium pain, rises if `DurationMin > 50` or `PreOpGrimace > 3`.
* **Weight Adjustment:** +5 points if `WeightKg > 3.5` (heavier rabbits show more tissue stress).

**Outputs:**

* `BaselineAnalgesiaNeedScore` (0–100)
* `BaselineAnalgesiaNeedCategory` (Low / Medium / High)


### Veterinary Rationale

* Encodes **domain knowledge** from rabbit pain literature.
